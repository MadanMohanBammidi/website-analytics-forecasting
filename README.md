## üìä Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of website performance metrics using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data. It combines exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning to derive actionable insights and forecast future traffic patterns.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Deep dive into user behavior and engagement metrics
- **Channel Performance Evaluation**: Comparative analysis of different traffic sources
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Rich visual representations of key performance indicators
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predictive modeling of future website traffic
- **Engagement Metrics Analysis**: In-depth analysis of user engagement patterns

## üîç Technical Approach

### 1. Data Analysis Pipeline
``` python
Data Collection (GA4) ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Visualization ‚Üí Forecasting
```

### 2. Key Metrics Analyzed

- **User Engagement Metrics**
  - Average engagement time per session
  - Events per session
  - Engagement rate
  - Engaged sessions per user

- **Traffic Source Analysis**
  - Channel-wise user distribution
  - Session quality by source
  - Conversion patterns
  - User retention rates

### 3. Visualization Strategy

The project employs a multi-layered visualization approach:

- **Correlation Analysis**: Scatter plots showing relationships between different engagement metrics
- **Channel Performance**: Bar charts comparing different traffic sources
- **Time Series Patterns**: Line plots showing traffic trends
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Dynamic visualizations for real-time analysis

## üìà Key Findings

1. **Engagement Patterns**
   - Strong correlation between session duration and event frequency
   - Higher engagement rates in returning users
   - Channel-specific engagement variations

2. **Traffic Source Impact**
   - Organic search delivers highest quality traffic
   - Social media shows high volume but lower engagement
   - Direct traffic indicates strong brand recognition

3. **User Behavior Insights**
   - Peak engagement times identified
   - User journey patterns mapped
   - Drop-off points analyzed
